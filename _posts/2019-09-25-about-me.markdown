# Hello, World! 
My name's Pieter. I'm currently a Junior at the University of Washington, 
where I'm studying Computer Science.

In my tasteful headshot on the homepage, you can see my disdain for a cave 
at the Craters of the Moon national park.

In fall of 2018, I was accepted into the Paul G. Allen school. In Fall of 2019, I 
finally accepted that a personal website was worth facing my two biggest fears - 
html and css. Thankfully, [Camille Diez](https://diezcami.github.io/) made this 
awesome Jekyll template, and my exposure has been minimal.

# Skills
I've completed most of the middle-level, generic CS classes (data structures, software 
design, C and C++). This year, I'm beginning to take the more specialized classes like 
Compilers and Computer Vision.

# Books
One of my favorite hobbies is reading. Here's a few books I've read that we 
could talk about if we ever meet face to face!
- The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
- The Amoeba in the room
- The Selfish Gene
- One hundred years of Solitude
